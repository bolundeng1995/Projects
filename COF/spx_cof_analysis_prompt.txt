You are a quantitative researcher tasked with analyzing the SPX (S&P 500) equity cost of financing (COF) and its relationship with market liquidity indicators. Your analysis should focus on the following key components:

1. Theoretical Framework:
- The futures price (F) must satisfy: F = S × (1 + r + s) – E[D]
- Where:
  * F = futures contract price
  * S = spot price of the index
  * r = risk-free interest rate
  * s = spread over/under risk-free rate (COF)
  * E[D] = expected dividends

2. Primary Analysis:
- Develop a linear regression model where:
  * Dependent variable (Y): COF level
  * Independent variable (X): CFTC Asset Manager net long notional in SPX
- Use a rolling 1-year window for model training
- For each date, only use the past 1 year of data to train the model
- Calculate fair value COF using the model
- Compare actual COF levels with model-predicted fair values

3. Liquidity Analysis:
- Incorporate additional liquidity indicators:
  * Fed Funds-SOFR spread
  * Swap spread
  * JPYUSD basis
- Analyze how these indicators correlate with COF levels
- Investigate whether periods of liquidity stress correspond to COF levels above fair value

4. Output Requirements:
- Generate time series of:
  * Actual COF levels
  * Model-predicted fair value COF
  * Difference between actual and fair value
  * Key liquidity indicators
- Provide statistical analysis of:
  * Model fit metrics
  * Correlation between liquidity indicators and COF
  * Significance of deviations from fair value

5. Visualization:
- Create plots showing:
  * COF levels vs. fair value
  * Liquidity indicators over time
  * Scatter plots of key relationships
  * Rolling correlations

6. Interpretation Guidelines:
- Identify periods where actual COF significantly deviates from fair value
- Analyze whether deviations correspond to liquidity stress periods
- Provide insights on potential trading opportunities based on COF mispricing

7. Trading Strategy Backtesting:
- Develop a systematic trading strategy based on:
  * COF mispricing signals (actual vs. fair value)
  * Liquidity stress indicators
- Strategy Components:
  * Entry/exit rules based on:
    - COF deviation thresholds
    - Liquidity indicator thresholds
    - Combined signal strength
  * Position sizing methodology
  * Risk management rules
- Backtesting Requirements:
  * Use out-of-sample data for validation
  * Implement realistic transaction costs
  * Account for market impact
  * Consider liquidity constraints
  * Include proper slippage assumptions
- Performance Metrics:
  * Sharpe ratio
  * Maximum drawdown
  * Win rate
  * Profit factor
  * Average trade duration
  * Risk-adjusted returns
  * Correlation with market returns
- Robustness Testing:
  * Parameter sensitivity analysis
  * Different market regimes
  * Various liquidity conditions
  * Transaction cost scenarios

Please ensure all analysis is conducted using Python, with appropriate statistical packages and visualization tools. The code should be well-documented and include proper error handling and data validation.
